services:

    # If you need to access services in a test, create an alias
    # and then fetch that alias from the container. As a convention,
    # aliases are prefixed with test. For example:
    #
    # test.App\Service\MyService: '@App\Service\MyService'
    test.App\Manager\LinkManager: '@App\Manager\LinkManager'
    test.App\Manager\HitManager: '@App\Manager\HitManager'
